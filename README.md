# Java Fundamentals course
In this repository, I collected some homework assignments, as well as the final project - <b>#Money Transfer APP</b>, 
which I completed during the second stage of the courses at the IT Academy (Basic Course).

All of them were executed in the <ins>IntelliJ IDEA</ins> development environment.
